	* Description of the Method: This is the main of the program where we
	* execute the whole problem. First we create a Scanner and three stacks 
	* that we will be using for the problem. Then we create a Problem object 
	* and we ask for the the route of the file that should be introduced by 
	* terminal. After this we create a ReadFile object and when this is done 
	* we call the methods read_File and the method fill_Stacks to fill the 
	* stacks that we need to the end of the program. After this we will call 
	* the method nine_counter and print the number of nines that we count
