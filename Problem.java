	* Description of the Method: First of all it will check if 
	* the received stack is empty. Then this method will fill the stacks 
	* one by one checking if the addition of the number in the array 
	* and the number on the top of the first stack is 9 or not, 
	* depending on the result we will increase the first or the second 
	* stack. In case the first stack is empty the number of the received stack   
	* will be pushed on this stack. On the end we will return the 
	* second_Stack that we will have to use later.
	*																	 
	* Calling arguments: In this method we introduce a stack which will have 
	* all the numbers from the file in the correct order.  
	* 																     
	* Return value: This method will return a stack with numbers, called
	* second_Stack
